# LocationIncorporator
By Venkatram, Gap Analyst AOEC 2021

Project name: Location Incorporator (Work in progress, design specification stage only)

Please review our Pitch presentation to understand our aim and solution finding.

Aim: We know of hybrid vehicles that switch between ICE to EV. Tomorrow, this decision making may need to be assisted by a Mobilizer Control Unit that uses RoadMIR Desks and vehicle enabled location data. The new Mobilizer Control Unit will need to be evaluated for scope and purpose by automotive engineering companes and vehicle manufacturers but the Location Incorporation solution can proceed irrespective.

## Inspiration
Machine learning algorithms are being incorporated in many areas of problem solving. We think that tomorrow Grids could decide modes of operations of vehicles, as location analytics could report the availability of refueling/battery recharging/vehicle maintenance facilities, infrastructure and at-site services that can help people commute 

## What it does
The problem solving called "Location Incorporated" is a solution that expects to use location data from a vehicle (*Ford or Lincoln or in this case a simulated vehicle) to instantiate sustainable recommendations for the mode in which a vehicle must run. The problem solving incorporates this in a proof of concept website created for Drive-India showcasing and safer commuting.

As we are participating from outside the U.S 
The problem solving will design a solution independent of the need for the Ford Connectivity API(s), as there are many APIs that can be used to obtain location data from a vehicle or device in a vehicle.

As location data is typically Latitude, Longitude and in some scenarios chronological quotients associated with the location, we improve upon this concept to add a sphere of control for a location.

The sphere of control (SOC) for a location can be (a) ASSET RADII or (b) Associated SMART Cloud clusters

As the First version of the sphere of control: ASSET RADII can include indicators for Re-fuelling facilities, Battery recharge facilities, Vehicle Maintenance facilities and Supply chain specific facilities. Tomorrow with the onset of Alternate fuels in vehicles, there may be Alternate Fuelling facilities. If vehicles were to run using solar energy, there would be solar panel / system facilities.

For SOC that includes ASSET RADII, the problem solving proposes the implementation of RoadKPI(s) and RoadMIR  Desks, where this has been described in the proof of concept site for road engineering and safer commuting.

As the NEXT version of the sphere of control: SMART Cloud Clusters can include profiles for climate or weather associated with a location, climate change mitigation & adaptation profiles associated with a location, Emergency Response services associated with a location, 24x7 services associated with a location, a Location Insight Centre associated with a location etc. We will not focus on this in this ideation.

Our team has entered different competitions and challenges for showcasing Electric Vehicles and Safer Commuting. We have trended needs that we find important to make the journey on the road safer and environmentally enabled.
